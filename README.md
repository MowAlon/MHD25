# Mile High Dreamin' 2025
At MHD 2025, I showed off several tools I think can make your Salesforce life easier.
With the exception of the "Why Salesforce" Chrome extension, I built these projects from the ground up, though I may have used other tools in the process. In the case of "Why Salesforce", it was originally developed by [Warren Walters](https://github.com/walters954/why-salesforce). I loved it so much, and it's open-source, so I contributed and built out some important functionality.
