# Mile High Dreamin' 2025
At the 2025 MHD, I showed off several tools I think can make your Salesforce life easier.
With the exception of the "Why Salesforce" Chrome extension, I built these projects from the ground up, though I may have used other tools in the process. In the case of "Why Salesforce", it was originally developed by [Warren Walters](https://github.com/walters954/why-salesforce). I loved it so much, and it's open-source, so I contributed and built out some important functionality.

These are links to dedicated instructions for how to use each of the tools contained in this repo... some with more solid documentation than others.
